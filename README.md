# Task-6
JavaScript Classes and Objects README
=====================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains three JavaScript scripts (`script.js`, `script1.js`, `script2.js`, and `script3.js`) that define classes and demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts. Each script focuses on a different class, including `Person`, `Circle`, and `UberPrice`, as well as a static method for filtering movies by rating in the `Movie` class.

File Structure
--------------
* `index.html` - The main HTML file 

*   `script.js`: Defines the `Person` class and creates an instance with default values.
*   `script1.js`: Defines the `Circle` class and demonstrates its methods for manipulating circle properties.
*   `script2.js`: Defines the `UberPrice` class and creates instances to calculate travel costs based on distance, vehicle type, and AC usage.
*   `script3.js`: Defines the `Movie` class with a static method to filter movies by rating.

Code Explanation
----------------

### `script.js` (Person Class)

*   Defines a `Person` class with default values for a person's details.
*   Includes a `getPerson` method to retrieve the person's details.

### `script1.js` (Circle Class)

*   Defines a `Circle` class with methods to get and set radius, get and set color, calculate area, calculate circumference, and display the circle as a string.
*   Creates an instance of the `Circle` class and demonstrates the usage of its methods.

### `script2.js` (UberPrice Class)

*   Defines an `UberPrice` class for calculating travel costs based on distance, vehicle type, and AC usage.
*   Includes methods to get distance, get vehicle type, get the price, and display travel details as a string.
*   Creates instances of the `UberPrice` class with different parameters and displays the travel details.

### `script3.js` (Movie Class)

*   Defines a `Movie` class representing a movie with title, studio, and rating.
*   Includes a static method `getPG` to filter movies by a specific rating ("PG").
*   Creates instances of the `Movie` class and demonstrates the static method to filter movies with a "PG" rating.
How to Run
----------

1.  Ensure you have a web browser installed on your system.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Notes
-----

*   Modify the class properties and methods or create new instances with different values for testing.
*   Explore and adapt the code to understand and experiment with object-oriented programming concepts
